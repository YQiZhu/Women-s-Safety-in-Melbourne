# Women's Safety in Melbourne (Android Mobile App)
The main objective of this project is to improve the safety of women living or travelling in Melbourne. To meet the needs of the project, the product should contain a number of features that will help. Firstly, when women are in public places, the product will allow them to view their current location in real time and provide navigation to safe locations that exist nearby. The product should also provide a way to contact emergency contacts, including sending a distress text message to the contact with the user's current location, calling the emergency contact or call to police. Finally, we will also provide statistics and visualisations of crime in Melbourne's suburbs to help users better understand the security situation in each area of Melbourne. We have developed an Android application and have ensured that it meets the requirements required above.
